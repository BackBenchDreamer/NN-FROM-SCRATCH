# Neural Network From Scratch

This project implements a simple **Neural Network** from scratch using only **NumPy** (without deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch).  
It is designed as a learning resource to understand the fundamentals of forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
